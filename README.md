# 16S
This file contains the code and instructions using the Mothur software to classify the mice gut microbiota from 16S rRNA paired-end sequences, with the SILVA database as a reference.

The pipeline includes:

Creating and cleaning sequence contigs.
Filtering sequences (removal of ambiguous sequences, duplicates, and chimeras).
Aligning sequences with the SILVA reference database.
Taxonomic classification based on OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) by comparison with SILVA.
