# 16S
This file contains the code and instructions for using the Mothur software to classify the gut microbiota of mice from paired-end 16S rRNA FASTQ sequences, using the SILVA database as a reference. 

The pipeline includes:
Creating and cleaning sequence contigs.
Filtering sequences (removal of ambiguous sequences, duplicates, and chimeras).
Aligning sequences with the SILVA reference database.
Taxonomic classification based on OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) by comparison with SILVA.
